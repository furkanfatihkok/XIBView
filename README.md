# XIBView

 My XIBView package is a package that contains mandatory XIB methods when we create a custom view.


## Installation

1. Add the project as a Swift package. Add the following line to your `Package.swift` file:

    ```swift
    .package(url: "(https://github.com/furkanfatihkok/XIBView)", from: "1.0.0")
    ```

2. Add the project to your target package and start using it.


## Usage

We add it into the created custom View by saying import XIBView. 
Immediately afterwards, we call the override and required methods and add the configureNibView() function and our project becomes operational.
